# Hangman

My attempt at making a Hangman console application.

Made by Svetozar Blazhev  
Made in IntelliJ with Java  
To run, you can always just download Main.class and Categories.txt  
and import them in a blank application of your IDE.  
Additional information provided in the application.

In future versions / To be added :
 - Score to be saved in a file and then obtained upon loading the application
 - Implementation of a HighScore system
 - Code refactoring - using classes instead of methods
 - The ability to choose a category by writing a letter instead of the whole category name
 - Porting this to JavaFX code so its not a console application anymore ( ? )
